## Introduction

This is an R package developed for implementing the Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Small Area Prediction methodology under a zero-inflated lognormal model with correlated random effects proposed in the manuscript of Lyu, Berg and Hofmann.

## Installation

Run the following from an R console:

``` r
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
